<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋 I'm Dennis Nyarko.</h1>

### 🤔 About Me 
I am a results-driven developer with experience in delivering software solutions. I am a quick learner and have a strong understanding of software development methodologies and best practices. I am passionate about technology and I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. I am a strong communicator and can work effectively in a team environment. Below is an overview on my tech stack & skills: 

### 👨‍💻 Skills & Stack  

- Languages and frameworks: Javascript, Typescript, React, Express.js, Node.js | Python, Django.

As a developer focused on back-end development using Node.js and Python, I'm also able to build simple full-stack web applications with the help of React on the front-end.

- API: REST, GraphQL 

- Database: MongoDB, MySQL 

- Hosting: Hostinger, Heroku, Netlify 

### 📈 My Current Focus 
With most of my developer experience being from freelance and building side projects, I am looking to officially transition into the corporate world of software development and I’d appreciate any form of support and opportunities to help me achieve this. I am also actively searching for entry-level or junior developer roles or internships. You’re most welcome to reach out if you can assist in any way.
